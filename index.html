    <h3>Sports and Hobbies:</h3>
    <p>
        One of my longest participations in sport was playing rugby. I started at the age of four and have only recently
        stopped playing to focus on other activities. In total I played for three different clubs over the years: Old
        Cranleighans RFC, King’s KCS Old Boys RFC, and most recently Reeds Weybridge RFC. My normal position was a
        second row forward. One of my proudest moments was in spring 2019 when we came runners up in the Surrey
        Waterfall Cup. Rugby taught me many skills which really helped me in daily life such as discipline, sportsmanship,
        determination and staying calm under pressure.<br><br>During the latter half of the covid pandemic when restrictions were relaxed, I signed up to a local martial arts club to
        learn the disciplines Muay Thai, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) taking five to six classes a week, and
        I keep to this routine. I also do weightlifting in the club’s gym twice a week, and I do this to keep my strong and
        healthy.<br><br> Aside from sports I really enjoy entertaining people and having a laugh. I was able to achieve this by having a
        YouTube channel peaking at 120 subscribers and being able to make videos such as horror games and animations
        using SFX. I could do this by editing my videos using software such as Shotcut. I also started another channel on
        YouTube specifically for gaming videos only.<br><br>I have also recently started learning C++ and the OOP structure with it. Using what I learnt and the basics, I was able
        to make a nought and crosses game within a couple of hours. From here, I would like to also widen my coding skills
        from C++ and be able to branch out to different programming languages such as GCS Script and using different
        libraries such as SDL2 to create games with a graphical interface. And currently, I have made multiple games with
        SFML such as Connect 4, snake, etcetera while continuing to learn more of it (C++ graphics library).
